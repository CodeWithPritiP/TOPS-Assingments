    <h1>What are keys in React, and what happens if you do not provide a unique key?</h1>

    <h2>Keys in React</h2>
    <p>Keys are unique identifiers used by React to track elements in a list. They help optimize rendering by allowing React to determine which items have changed.</p>
    <h2>Consequences of Missing Unique Keys</h2>
    <p>Performance Issues: React may re-render more components than necessary.
    Incorrect State: It can lead to issues with component state and behavior, as components may not update correctly.</p>
