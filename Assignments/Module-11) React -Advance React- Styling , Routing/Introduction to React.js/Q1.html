    <h1>What is React.js? How is it different from other JavaScript frameworks and
        libraries?</h1>

        <p>React.js is a JavaScript Library developed by meta for building user interface specially single-page application. It is used for developing interactive, resuable component, making it easy to create dynamic and responsive web apps. React focuses on the view layer in (MVC model,the 'V' in ) and employs a component-based architecture</p>
