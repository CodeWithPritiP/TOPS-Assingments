    <h1>Explain the core principles of React such as the virtual DOM and componentbased architecture</h1>
    <h3>Core Principles of React:</h3>
    <h5>Virual DOM</h5>
    <p>React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. Instead of directly manipulating the browser's DOM, react create a Lightweight copy(virtual dom). when changes occur react update's only the affected parts of the real dom, making updates faster and more efficient</p>

    <h5>Component-Based Architecture:</h5>
    <p>React application are built using component which are modular, resuable piece of the UI. each component manages its own logic and rendering, making the code easier to maintain debug and scale.</p>
