    <h1>Why do you need to bind event handlers in class components?</h1>
   <p>In class components, event handlers are bound to the component instance to ensure the correct this context. Without binding, this may refer to undefined or the global object, leading to errors. Binding can be done in the constructor or using class properties with arrow functions, ensuring that the handler maintains the proper context when invoked.
