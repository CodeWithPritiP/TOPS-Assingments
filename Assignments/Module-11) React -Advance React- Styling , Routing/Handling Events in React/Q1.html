    <h1>How are events handled in React compared to vanilla JavaScript? Explain the
        concept of synthetic events.</h1>

        <p>In React, events are handled using camelCase syntax, and functions are passed as props. Unlike vanilla JavaScript, where you directly manipulate the DOM, React uses a virtual DOM for efficient updates.</p>

        <h3>Synthetic Events</h3>
        <h5>Definition:</h5>
        <p> A cross-browser wrapper around native events.</p>
    <h5>Benefits:</h5>
        <p>Normalizes event properties and ensures consistent behavior across browsers. They are pooled for performance, meaning the event properties are nullified after the event callback is invoked.</p>
